# WordPress Plugin Template

I made this plugin template as a starting point for creating WordPress plugins. Instead of starting from scratch, you can copy this folder directly into your WordPress plugins folder and have a functionally working plugin with some standard plugin setup configurations. 

## Features

* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.
* Full text of the GPLv2 license.

## Installation

The Template can be installed directly into your plugins folder, where you can rename it and the classes inside to fit your needs.
